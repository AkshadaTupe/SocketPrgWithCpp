In this Project we are going to focus on sending CSV File from client to server

# Client:

- Creates a socket and connects to the server.
- Opens the CSV file
-Sends the file data to the server.

# Server:

- Creates a socket, binds it to a port, and listens for incoming connections.
- Accepts a connection from a client.
- Receives the file data from the client and writes it to a new file.
